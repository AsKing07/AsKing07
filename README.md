## A Bit More Detail

In 2021, I embarked on my journey in web development. Thanks to **Openclassroms website**, I discovered programming and developed a keen interest in web development and development in general.

Over the course of two years of learning and practical experience, I successfully worked on complex web projects using HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MYSQL, and WordPress. This experience led me to collaborate with a local company, **[WomenEdTech](https://womenedtech.com)** where I continued to expand my skillset.



I then ventured into freelancing, attracting numerous clients and engaging in exciting and diverse projects. During this time, I pursued my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering.



Today, my commitment to learning and sharing knowledge remains unwavering. I am particularly interested in  **Web Development, AI and SaaS**.
